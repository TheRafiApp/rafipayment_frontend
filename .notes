Vue notes

DOCKER

- Public Site
  - node or nginx

- Public Site Tiny Backend
  - node

- Sockets Server
  - node

- App Front End
  - nginx




NOTIF DESIGNER IDEAS

- switch back end to node, mainly for single install convenience
- convert to jinja2 templates?
- sick editor to allow for CRUD in browser or not
- release to npm and profit


Things to document

BE
- when do users get notifications
- when are bills generated? charged? for different types of bills?

FE
- Modals
- Transitions
- General UI notes
- Environment mgmt
- All custom plugins / components / filters / validations


- make VueCollection api compatible with VueModel

X- figure out why testing isnt working
X- switch testing to Jest
- write additional tests
- write documentation
  - onboarding
- separate VueModel into its own repository
X- genericize
- collection is still using _id

const config = {
  methods: {
    fetch() {
      return Request(this.fetch_url)
    },
    save() {
      return Request(this.save_url)
    },
    destroy() {
      return Request(this.destory_url)
    }
  }
}
Vue.use(VueModel, config)



WHAT IS LEFT TO DO

/account is exposing password, auth data


rafiproperties@gmail.com
burritos4dogzRawesome


X- invite test users!
- process testing feedback

- update public site
  X- add buttons for App Store, Google Play
  - write some copy about the native app

- submit public apps to app stores, get approval
- prepare communication to tenants




X- add timeout to requests
- use service workers to check for offline mode

X- there is an alert stuck on the app somehow?


UI/UX designer

WHAT WE NEED
https://medium.com/@dasilva_jill/how-to-hire-a-ux-designer-d17b360d926d
https://uxdesign.cc/the-ux-of-hiring-for-ux-positions-255b6149066e

interview-
Come up with a design challenge
UX designers should ask a lot of questions



- semi-independently think about ux and ui
- someone who can help improve and refine the product
- someone who can write copy talking about what the product is
- someone who can talk about additional features while maintaining the integrity and values of the product
- someone who can help to inform user experience
- someone who can work with us as a peer
- someone who is excited about the product and working with our team

- our process gets slowed down because we dont have enough help planning ux and designing stuff, not because we dont have enough coders




Android deep linking notes

- Add domain to Google Webmasters
- Link domain to Google Play console account
- add ./well-known/assetlinks.json

- test with
  adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "https://app.payment.rafiproperties.com/dashboard" com.rafi.payment


X- set time for testing
X- refetch account in account views!!!!!!!!!!!!
X- logging in as a different user seems broken
X- collin's bug

X- universal links for android

- update public site
- google index public site

BACK END

- Commercial leasing seems to have different needs from residential


- inviting a removed user is really weird, it kind of just unremoves them
- back end make IAV tokens endpoints consistent
X- back end made /bills and /account/bills both resolve lease
X- /activate/contact doesn't show terms accepted

X- microdeposits
  X- when dwolla responds with a 200, update cache to verified?
  X- need some solution to pending verification
X- IAV is still always setting primary - change to POST

X- transfers
  X- BE should respond with dwolla response so we can show errors right away

- person pays, roommate doesn't, overdue bill email should be "not fully paid"

FRONT END


X- make app handle urls!



X- add some success visual when they finish onboarding...


Pay your rent with Rafi Payment! You'll receive automatic reminders and notifications when your rent is due, and regarding bills and payments, or you can set up autopay and forget about it!

You must be a tenant of Rafi Properties to use Rafi Payment.



X- transfer auto suggest is sometimes zero
X- after making a transfer, redirect to details page
X- past bills undefined address
X- bill details - show nice green thing if paid
- dwolla logo during bank activation step?
- stylesheet for IAV


X- password validation is acting weird
X- test on ipad

X- account payment
  X- collection is fucked up when adding
  X- update fs status on md success

X- move account payment from a tab to a list item
X- profile more native looking
X- update Xcode

X- move app loading logic to load.js, not load.vue
X- bug - edit split, then cancel, split is blank!

Z- store password in keychain

X- load component is broken
X- figure out why load component breaks


- add success indicator in onboarding
- set up basic tests!


BIG CHANGES IF LEASING
- brokers want MLS integreation when it comes to leasing. we could no longer assume that the yser owns the builfing
- Need a legal precesnse to look over everything
- need to define what the goals are
  - we probably need more peopel before we can sell to other comoanies



X- add sentry to app
- set up api endpoint for tracking errors

- cancel transfer endpoint is inconsistent
  - dwolla/transfer/:id/cancel
  - transfers/:id

- number component
  - maybe tabfocus=int should be a prop
X- use overflow: hidden to prevent scrolling when modals are open, loading

put qr code in invite email, open native app for first time and scan

X- deal with token expired

X- ask dwolla about passing insecure stylesheets in sandbox

- add modals to the confirm disbale or enable autopay feature
X- shouldnt be able to scroll while loading is a thing
- forgot / reset buttons should be button.link
X- activation flow split confirm is broken
X- funding source cards need love
  X- always sho buttons? shome disabled? icons?

X- remove cordova plugins and have user use phonegap prepare to install all of them

- model.save - if no change, resolve but pass false? or use model.changed?
X- set up microdeposits


- in the future, care less about verifying email, show that changing email is a danger zone, just overwrite email address immediately to simplify


- dont tell tenants rent is overdue, just say DUE again

Z- transfer is waiting for webhook to create cancel_expiration

- Google Analytics on mobile?
X- vue router scrolling onroute


TODO

X- remove phonegap/cordova deps out of repo, into an install script
Z- maybe use Vue with Vuex for collection to make API more consistent


- filtering should work more like excel, just remove useless filters from lists
- travis tests
