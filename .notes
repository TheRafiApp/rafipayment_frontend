DOCKER

- Public Site

SESSION 
- Login with creds
- Login with tokens

PUSH notifications
- get .cer file from apple
- convert .cer directly to .pem 
  openssl x509 -inform der -in cert.cer -out cert.pem
- get .cer developer identity
- convert to .p12 in keychain access
- convert .p12 to .pem with a password
  openssl pkcs12 -in private.p12 -out key.pem -nocerts
- combine the cert and the key together
  cat key.pem cert.pem > dev.pem
- NOTE: APNS token types are dependent on how the app is build (use an archived ipa for prod testing)

Android deep linking notes

- Add domain to Google Webmasters
- Link domain to Google Play console account
- add ./well-known/assetlinks.json

- test with
  adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "https://app.payment.rafiproperties.com/dashboard" com.rafi.payment


  - test push notifs in prod
    - test on ed's phone
    - make anytime bill
    - make $1 payment

- form novalidate currency -> stop using number input probably


- marketing site seo
- handle models notfound



NOTIF DESIGNER IDEAS

- switch back end to node, mainly for single install convenience
- convert to jinja2 templates?
- sick editor to allow for CRUD in browser or not
- release to npm and profit


Things to document

BE
- when do users get notifications
- when are bills generated? charged? for different types of bills?

FE
- Modals
- Transitions
- General UI notes
- Environment mgmt
- All custom plugins / components / filters / validations


X- make VueCollection api compatible with VueModel

X- figure out why testing isnt working
X- switch testing to Jest
X- write additional tests
- write documentation
  - onboarding
- separate VueModel into its own repository
- collection is still using _id




WHAT IS LEFT TO DO

/account is exposing password, auth data


rafiproperties@gmail.com
burritos4dogzRawesome

X- update public site
  X- add buttons for App Store, Google Play
  - write some copy about the native app
  - add images/video



- use service workers to check for offline mode


UI/UX designer

WHAT WE NEED
https://medium.com/@dasilva_jill/how-to-hire-a-ux-designer-d17b360d926d
https://uxdesign.cc/the-ux-of-hiring-for-ux-positions-255b6149066e

interview-
Come up with a design challenge
UX designers should ask a lot of questions



- semi-independently think about ux and ui
- someone who can help improve and refine the product
- someone who can write copy talking about what the product is
- someone who can talk about additional features while maintaining the integrity and values of the product
- someone who can help to inform user experience
- someone who can work with us as a peer
- someone who is excited about the product and working with our team

- our process gets slowed down because we dont have enough help planning ux and designing stuff, not because we dont have enough coders

- sentry blacklist
- robomongo
  host: staging.rafipayment.com
  auth:
    db: admin
    user: user
    password: password


BACK END

- Commercial leasing seems to have different needs from residential


- inviting a removed user is really weird, it kind of just unremoves them
- back end make IAV tokens endpoints consistent

- person pays, roommate doesn't, overdue bill email should be "not fully paid"
- dwolla logo during bank activation step?
- stylesheet for IAV


Pay your rent with Rafi Payment! You'll receive automatic reminders and notifications when your rent is due, and regarding bills and payments, or you can set up autopay and forget about it!
You must be a tenant of Rafi Properties to use Rafi Payment.


BIG CHANGES IF LEASING
- brokers want MLS integreation when it comes to leasing. we could no longer assume that the yser owns the builfing
- Need a legal precesnse to look over everything
- need to define what the goals are
  - we probably need more peopel before we can sell to other comoanies

- cancel transfer endpoint is inconsistent
  - dwolla/transfer/:id/cancel
  - transfers/:id

- add modals to the confirm disbale or enable autopay feature
- forgot / reset buttons should be button.link

- model.save - if no change, resolve but pass false? or use model.changed?
- in the future, care less about verifying email, show that changing email is a danger zone, just overwrite email address immediately to simplify
- dont tell tenants rent is overdue, just say DUE again

- vue router scrolling onroute (workin in desktop but not mobile)


- filtering should work more like excel, just remove useless filters from lists
- update invite email
- build debug API swapper
- make bank account cards nicer
- use password strength on validate?
