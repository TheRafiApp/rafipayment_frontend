- Public Site
  - node or nginx

- Public Site Tiny Backend

- Sockets Server
  - node

- App Front End
  - nginx




NOTIF DESIGNER IDEAS

- switch back end to node, mainly for single install convenience
- convert to jinja2 templates?
- sick editor to allow for CRUD in browser or not
- release to npm and profit


Things to document

BE
- when do users get notifications
- when are bills generated? charged? for different types of bills?

FE
- Modals
- Transitions
- General UI notes
- Environment mgmt
- All custom plugins / components / filters / validations
- Write fucking tests jesus christ



BACK END

- back end make IAV tokens endpoints consistent
- back end made /bills and /account/bills both resolve lease
- /activate/contact doesn't show terms accepted

- microdeposits
  - when dwolla responds with a 200, update cache to verified?
  - need some solution to pending verification
- IAV is still always setting primary

- transfers
  - BE should respond with dwolla response so we can show errors right away

- person pays, roommate doesn't, overdude bill email should be "not fully paid"

FRONT END

- move account payment from a tab to a list item
- update Xcode

X- move app loading logic to load.js, not load.vue
X- bug - edit split, then cancel, split is blank!

Z- store password in keychain

X- load component is broken
X- figure out why load component breaks



- profile more native looking



- cancel transfer endpoint is inconsistent
  - dwolla/transfer/:id/cancel
  - transfers/:id

- number component
  - maybe tabfocus=int should be a prop
X- use overflow: hidden to prevent scrolling when modals are open, loading

put qr code in invite email, open native app for first time and scan

X- deal with token expired

X- ask dwolla about passing insecure stylesheets in sandbox

- add modals to the confirm disbale or enable autopay feature
X- shouldnt be able to scroll while loading is a thing
- forgot / reset buttons should be button.link
X- activation flow split confirm is broken
X- funding source cards need love
  X- always sho buttons? shome disabled? icons?

X- remove cordova plugins and have user use phonegap prepare to install all of them

- model.save - if no change, resolve but pass false? or use model.changed?
X- set up microdeposits


- in the future, care less about verifying email, show that changing email is a danger zone, just overwrite email address immediately to simplify

- add success indicator in onboarding
- add sentry to app



- dont tell tenants rent is overdue, just say DUE again

- finish tenant app in a reasonable amount of time
  - resolve design issues
  - testing, details
  - debugging
  - deployment

- transfer is waiting for webhook to create cancel_expiration

- Google Analytics on mobile?
- vue router scrolling onroute


TODO

- remove phonegap/cordova deps out of repo, into an install script
- maybe use Vue with Vuex for collection to make API more consistent


- filtering should work more like excel, just remove useless filters from lists
- travis tests




- ACTIVATION FLOW
  - include links to the app store stuff in the email?
  - or link to the website where they can get the links

- build debug API swapper
- make bank account cards nicer

- resolve scrolling woes
